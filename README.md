# StockHawk
An app that tracks stocks!

## Work Done on App
 In this project I have productionized an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. To do this I have:
 
 * Found and handled error cases
 * Fixed a major bug
 * Added accessibility features
 * Allowed for localization
 * Added widgets
 * Added a library
 * Used Retrofit API to get data from YQL
